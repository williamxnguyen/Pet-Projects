# A Self-Taught Data Scientist

My name is William Nguyen. 

At the beginning of 2017, I was stuck in a dead end job whilst completing a degree in Civil Engineering I didn't have interest in. After some serious self-reflection about what I really want; 
I knew my passion lied in the realm of Data Science and its application in business and Artificial Intelligence. I commited to learning everything I could about machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. 

I built my own curriculum so I can ensure I know what I am studying, the material I will be working through for hours; as well as hundreds of useful resources to be utilized at my hands and committed between 4-6 hours each day to learn the basics. 

Fast forward today, where I am enrolled into a Bachelors of Advanced Statistics program at the University of New South Wales; where I will be doing my Masters of Computer Science in Data Science and Engineering. 

Hopefully, this repository can help others to get an edge in data science. I am excited by all the things I have learned and love the fact that I get to work on something I am deeply excited about each day. 

I further hope to get an internship experience whilst I pursue my undergraduate and postgraduate studies so I can engage with other like-minded people to implement machine learning models in real world production systems.
